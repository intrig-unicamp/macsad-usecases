# Description

This folder contains P4 programs using version 16. In this folder we solve the following use cases:

-l2_fwd: One of the most simple tests in P4, it considers a simple switch connected to hosts. The objective of this test is to test a simple layer two connection.

-l3_fwd_ipv4: Considering a layer higher than the example described before, this program simulates a layer three connection, using lpm implementation. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that this example was specifically made for IPv4 implementation.

-BNG: The Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) is the access point for subscribers. It is capable of establish user sessions, managing all traffic of them and routes it to public network.
