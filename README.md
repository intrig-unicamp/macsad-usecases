# Use Cases

This repository presents the MACSAD project supported dataplane applications written in P4 language.

The Multi-Architecture Compiler System for Abstract Dataplanes (MACSAD) is a P4 compiler that uses ODP aiming to achieve portability of dataplane applications across targets without compromising performance. 

The P4 programmes are placed in two separate folders according to their P4 version:

p4-14: contains p4 programs and their dependency graphs. E.g., l2_fwd, l3_fwd (IPv4 and IPv6), VxLAN.
p4-16: includes p4 programs and their dependency graphs. E.g., l2_fwd, l3_fwd (IPv4), BNG.
